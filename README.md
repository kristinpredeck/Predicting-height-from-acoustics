# Predicting-height-from-acoustics

This code produces regression plots and builds both a simple linear regression and multiple linear regression model using the scikit learn package. In the model code you find the whole modeling, including predicitve modeling using k-nearest neighbors, a decision tree, a support vector machine, and logistic regression.

If you want to adapt this code, simply switch out the data frame and rename the variables.
